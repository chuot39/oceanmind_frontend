   - Better room name formatting
   - Automatic room rejoining after reconnection
   - Retry mechanism for joining rooms

5. **Added better debugging capabilities**

   - More descriptive console logging
   - Test component for real-time notification testing

6. **Fixed recipientId comparison**

## Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to `/test/notifications` after logging in
2. Enter the recipient user ID (your own ID to test self-notifications)
3. Customize notification title and content
4. Click "Send Notification" to test
5. Check that notifications appear in the notification dropdown
6. Verify that toast notifications display for friend request notifications
